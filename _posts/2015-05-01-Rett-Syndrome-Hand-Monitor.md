Rett Syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting normal developmental behaviors in 1 in every 10,000 females born. The symptoms are often confused with autism, as the impaired brain function can often result in difficulties with speaking, learning, and movement. While this is only a short list of symptoms, the hallmark symptom of Rett Syndrome is hand stereotypies, or constant and repetitive hand movements.  

The Children's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts aims to study the effects of different therapeutics on the hand stereotypies of children with Rett Syndrome. We designed and built a prototype of a device that can monitor hand movements so that a comparison can be made between the child's symptoms before and in response to the therapeutics.

The device was built using Arduino and reads positional data using an accelerometer. The raw data is saved in a text file for easy manipulation by a multitude of computer programs.
