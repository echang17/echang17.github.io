Nanoparticles for Oligonucleotide and Curcumin Delivery to Breast Cancer Cells

1.3 million people around the world are directly affected by breast cancer, and many more are affected indirectly. Approximately 10-16% of breast cancer cases metastasize to the brain, which makes them even harder to treat due to the need for therapeutics to cross the blood-brain barrier. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one of the most aggressive forms of breast cancer with a 30-40% chance of recurrence. TNBC lacks all three of the common hormone receptors, so many typical chemotherapies are ineffective. Lower survival rate for this subtype in comparison to other breast cancers is almost certainly due to its hyperactive signaling pathways.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors have been used to reduce the cancer cell growth, but TNBC often has mutations in PTEN, a tumor-suppressor gene, which significantly reduces the impact of EGFR inhibitors alone to suppress TNBC tumors. The PTEN mutation induces hyperactivity in the PI3K pathway, allowing cancer cells to continue proliferating and avoid apoptosis. By targeting the PI3K pathway using oligonucleotides and curcumin, we hoped to suppress the pathway such that an EGFR inhibitor could be used in conjunction to renew the ability to achieve cell cycle arrest and apoptosis to destroy the tumor. 

We used calcium phosphate nanoparticles to deliver siRNA and lipid polymer hybrid nanoparticles to deliver curcumin to the cancer cells in separate, but parallel experiments. We characterized loading nanoparticles and release kinetics, before observing combinatory effects of each respective therapy with gefitinib, an EGFR inhibitor.
