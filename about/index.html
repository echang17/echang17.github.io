    <h2>Always hungry. Always foolish.</h2>
    <p style="font-size:1.25em">Hi, I’m Erin. I’m a scientist, an engineer, an insatiable pit of continuous hunger (for both food and knowledge), a washed-up soccer player, and a sports photographer.</p>
    <p style="font-size:1.25em">I graduated from Boston University with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering, where I worked on <a href="/projects/nanoparticles">nanoparticle drug delivery</a> and the <a href="/projects/bending">fluid mechanics of swellable structures</a>. I love building new things, so I decided to host this website on Github to tinker with web design and some basic coding!</p>
    <p style="font-size:1.25em">After BU, I conducted research at Stanford University, where I worked with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30510260">stem cells</a> and used CRISPR to manipulate <a href="https://www.jove.com/video/57457/crispr-mediated-reorganization-of-chromatin-loop-structure">chromatin architecture</a>. I am currently a Mechanical Engineering Ph.D. student and NSF Graduate Research Fellow at UC Berkeley, where I work on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11524">robotic systems</a> to augment human dexterity in the <href="https://edg.berkeley.edu/">Embodied Dexterity Group</href>.</p>
    <p style="font-size:1.25em">In my free time, I am also a freelance <a href="/sportsphoto">sports photographer</a>. I work primarily with Stanford Athletics, US Soccer, and the San Jose Earthquakes, but have created images for many other Division I athletics programs, as well as Street Soccer USA and F45 Training.</p>
