    <h2>Always hungry. Always foolish.</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m Erin. I’m a scientist, an engineer, an insatiable pit of continuous hunger (for both food and knowledge), a washed-up soccer player, and a sports photographer.</p>
    <p>I graduated from Boston University with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering, where I worked on <a href="/2017/05/05/Senior-Design-Thesis-Project.html">nanoparticle drug delivery</a> and the <a href="/2015/08/24/Swelling-Induced-Bending.html">fluid mechanics of swellable structures</a>. My curiosity and passion for learning led me in all directions at BU; I love to try new things and found myself dabbling in a variety of subjects like computer science, software engineering, speech processing, business innovation, ice skating, and even powerlifting. I decided to host this website on Github so that I could tinker with web design and some basic coding!</p>
    <p>Now, I conduct research at Stanford University, where I work with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30510260">stem cells</a> and use CRISPR to manipulate <a href="https://www.jove.com/video/57457/crispr-mediated-reorganization-of-chromatin-loop-structure">chromatin architecture</a>. I am also an in-game and studio <a href="/sportsphoto">photographer</a> for Stanford Athletics, where I cover a variety of sports including Football, Volleyball, Soccer, Basketball, and Water Polo. Outside of Stanford Athletics, I have created images for the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team, the San Jose Earthquakes, Duke University Athletics, and Street Soccer USA.</p>
