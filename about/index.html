    <h2>Always hungry. Always foolish.</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m Erin. I’m a scientist, an engineer, an insatiable pit of continuous hunger, a washed-up soccer player, and a sports photographer.</p>
    <p>I graduated from Boston University with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering, where I worked on <a href="">nanoparticle drug delivery</a> and the <a href="">fluid mechanics of swellable structures</a>. When I wasn’t slaving away at problem sets or in the lab, I could usually be found on the indoor soccer courts or eating my way around Boston.</p>
    <p>Now, I conduct research at Stanford University, where I grow <a href"">stem cells</a> and use CRISPR to manipulate <a href="">chromatin architecture</a>. 
      I am also an in-game and studio photographer for Stanford Athletics, where I cover a variety of sports including Football, Volleyball, Soccer, Basketball, and Water Polo. Outside of Stanford, I have been contracted for the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team, the San Jose Earthquakes, and Duke University Athletics.</p>
