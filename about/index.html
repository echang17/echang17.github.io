    <p style="font-size:1.25em">An extremely subjective creative personality type quiz once described me as "always the perpetual student" (shout-out to <a href="https://mycreativetype.com/the-creative-types/">Adobe</a>). I love learning new things, which might explain why I spent 22 years of my life in school, why I turned my photography hobby into a sporadic freelance operation, or why I decided to try coding this website myself.</p>

    <p style="font-size:1.25em">Let's start with the STEM side of this portfolio. I hold a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Boston University, where I worked on <a href="/projects/nanoparticles">nanoparticle drug delivery</a> and the <a href="/projects/bending">fluid mechanics of swellable structures</a>. For a few years afterward, I worked as a researcher at Stanford University, where I investigated <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30510260">stem cell health</a> and used CRISPR to study <a href="https://www.jove.com/video/57457/crispr-mediated-reorganization-of-chromatin-loop-structure">cancer-related genomics</a>. Recently, I completed my M.S. and Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley in the <a href="https://edg.berkeley.edu/">Embodied Dexterity Group</a>, where I was an NSF Graduate Research Fellow developing <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10302320">robotic systems</a> to augment human hand function in people with spinal cord injuries. 
      Now, I'm a Research Engineer at <a href="https://www.gridware.io/">Gridware</a>, working to protect and monitor our fragile electrical grid.</p>

    <p style="font-size:1.25em">The other half of my portfolio encompasses my second passion: sports. I've competed in sports for as long as I can remember, and while I'm admittedly a bit washed-up now, <a href="/sportsphoto">sports photography</a> has allowed me to remain involved in sports at the highest levels. Soccer will always be my one true love and I've had the great honor of creating images for the U.S. Soccer Federation, Bay FC, the San Jose Earthquakes, and a number of Division I Athletic programs.</p>

    <p style="font-size:1.25em">Please reach out to me <a href="/contact">here</a> if you'd like to connect; I love a good conversation on science, robots, soccer, or anything in between!

I graduated from Boston University with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering, where I worked on <a href="/projects/nanoparticles">nanoparticle drug delivery</a> and the <a href="/projects/bending">fluid mechanics of swellable structures</a>. My interests gravitated toward human-centered science and engineering, so after graduation, I returned to my hometown as a Research Technician at Stanford University, where I worked with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30510260">stem cells</a> and used CRISPR to study <a href="https://www.jove.com/video/57457/crispr-mediated-reorganization-of-chromatin-loop-structure">cancer-related genomics</a>. I eventually decided to move from biology to mechanical engineering and completed my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley, where I was an NSF Graduate Research Fellow studying <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9812175">robotic systems</a> to augment human hand function in the <a href="https://edg.berkeley.edu/">Embodied Dexterity Group</a>.

    <!-- <p style="font-size:1.25em">Hi, I’m Erin. I’m a scientist, an engineer, an insatiable pit of continuous hunger (for both food and knowledge), a washed-up soccer player, and a sports photographer.</p>
    <p style="font-size:1.25em">I graduated from Boston University with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering, where I worked on <a href="/projects/nanoparticles">nanoparticle drug delivery</a> and the <a href="/projects/bending">fluid mechanics of swellable structures</a>. I love building new things, so I decided to host this website on Github to tinker with web design and some basic coding!</p>
    <p style="font-size:1.25em">After BU, I conducted research at Stanford University, where I worked with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30510260">stem cells</a> and used CRISPR to manipulate <a href="https://www.jove.com/video/57457/crispr-mediated-reorganization-of-chromatin-loop-structure">chromatin architecture</a>. I am currently a Mechanical Engineering Ph.D. student and NSF Graduate Research Fellow at UC Berkeley, where I work on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11524">robotic systems</a> to augment human dexterity in the <a href="https://edg.berkeley.edu/">Embodied Dexterity Group</a>.</p>
    <p style="font-size:1.25em">In my free time, I am also a freelance <a href="/sportsphoto">sports photographer</a>. I work primarily with Stanford Athletics, US Soccer, and the San Jose Earthquakes, but have created images for many other Division I athletics programs, as well as Street Soccer USA and F45 Training.</p> -->
