    <h2>Always hungry. Always foolish.</h2>
    <p style="font-size:1.25em">Hi, I’m Erin. I’m a scientist, an engineer, an insatiable pit of continuous hunger (for both food and knowledge), a washed-up soccer player, and a sports photographer.</p>
    <p style="font-size:1.25em">I graduated from Boston University with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering, where I worked on <a href="/2017/05/05/Senior-Design-Thesis-Project.html">nanoparticle drug delivery</a> and the <a href="/2015/08/24/Swelling-Induced-Bending.html">fluid mechanics of swellable structures</a>. I love building new things, so I decided to host this website on Github to tinker with web design and some basic coding!</p>
    <p style="font-size:1.25em">Most recently, I conducted research at Stanford University, where I worked with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30510260">stem cells</a> and used CRISPR to manipulate <a href="https://www.jove.com/video/57457/crispr-mediated-reorganization-of-chromatin-loop-structure">chromatin architecture</a>. I am now beginning my journey as Mechanical Engineering Ph.D. student and NSF Graduate Research Fellow at UC Berkeley.</p>
    <p style="font-size:1.25em">In my free time, I am also an in-game and studio <a href="/sportsphoto">photographer</a> for Stanford Athletics, where I cover Football, Volleyball, Soccer, Basketball, and Water Polo. Outside of Stanford Athletics, I have created images for the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team, the San Jose Earthquakes, Duke University Athletics, USC Athletics, Street Soccer USA, and F45 Training.</p>
