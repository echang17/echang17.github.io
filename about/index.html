    <h2>Always hungry. Always foolish.</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m Erin. I’m a scientist, an engineer, an insatiable pit of continuous hunger, a washed-up soccer player, and an aspiring photographer.</p>
    <p>I graduated from Boston University with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering, where I worked on nanoparticle drug delivery and the fluid mechanics of swellable structures. When I wasn’t slaving away at problem sets or in the lab, I could usually be found either on the indoor soccer courts or searching for new places to eat around Boston.</p>
    <p>Now, I conduct research at Stanford University in the Dermatology department, working on stem cells and chromatin architecture. In my free time, I cover photo assignments for Stanford Athletics, continue to search for a good game of socccer, and build things- like this website!</p>
