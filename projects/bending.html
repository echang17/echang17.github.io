  <h2><u>Background</u></h3>
  <p>In many natural instances, fluid interactions have been associated with swelling-induced shape changes of biological structures, such as wrinkling skin or growing leaves. One specific example is the flowering process of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA1QfuVluR0" target="_blank">Baobab</a> tree, where stored water buildup in closed flowers induces swelling on the inner surface of the petals. The swelling eventually reaches a maximum point, forcing the petals to peel back and expose the stamens and pistils.</p>
  <p></p>

  <h2><u>Overview</u></h2>
  <p>Drawing inspiration from these biological phenomena, I designed experiments to examine the swelling and bending mechanics of closed-beam silicone elastomers of different geometries and materials. By studying these dynamic shape changes, we can optimize applications of these predictable, controllable, and reversible materials in other engineering contexts such as soft robotic arms and mechanical sensors.</p>

  <h2><u>Methods</u></h2>
  <p>This project allowed me to get creative in building a custom experimental setup. I designed molds and refined fabrication prototols to make single channel rectangular beams with varying channel centroids, then vertically suspended and injected them with organic solvents. Using time-lapse photography, I characterized the bending trajectories of 3 elastomers with 3 fluids, supported by the Summer Term Alumni Research Scholars (STARS) Award.</p>

  <h2><u>Reflection</u></h2>
  <p> One critical component of this work was the fabrication protocol of the hollow beams, which took some iterations to determine the ideal method. I chose to attach two pieces together to create the fluid channel, since the beam length would make removal of a single flexible, long, hollow piece from the mold very difficult. I tested different bonding methods including plasma spray and uncured elastomer as an adhesive, finding that uncured elastomer enabled sufficient attachment, but a small amount needed to be applied carefully to prevent changing the geometry of the channel walls. From my final set of collected image data, I found that the material stiffness appeared to correlate with larger curvature and swelling. </p>
