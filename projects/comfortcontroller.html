  <p>The spread of COVID-19 and the resulting world-wide closures has forced many into spending prolonged periods of time at home. Digital entertainment usage such as video gaming has subsequently grown significantly as we try to find ways to enjoy ourselves from the comfort of our own homes. While the gaming industry appeals to diverse audiences, the most prevalent input devices are often standardized to fit an average hand and size. </p>
  <p></p>

  <p>Users with atypical hand morphologies or hand sizes can thus experience discomfort and difficulty reaching the necessary inputs, exacerbating risk for musculoskeletal disorders resulting from the sudden and heavy increase of specialized tool usage. We proposed the design of an ergonomic and adjustable computer video gaming controller that can be customized to fit a variety of hand morphologies.</p>
  <p></p>

  <p>Through a contextual inquiry with a user who has difficulty reaching some inputs on his primary controller, a standard computer gaming keyboard, we found that this user sought an easily integratable controller capable of both high intensity gaming and normal computing tasks, that was also compatible with their anatomy. Our final design resembled an ergonomic mouse shaped controller with sliding key banks and a joystick, to be used with the left hand, alongside a gaming mouse with the right hand. Digital inputs are fully customizable and able to map any key on a keyboard to the desired inputs.</p>
