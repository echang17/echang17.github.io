  <h2><u>Background</u></h2>
  <p>The spread of COVID-19 and the resulting world-wide closures forced many into spending prolonged periods of time at home. Digital entertainment usage such as video gaming has subsequently grown significantly as we tried to find ways to enjoy ourselves from the comfort of our own homes. While the gaming industry appeals to diverse audiences, the most prevalent input devices are often standardized to fit an average hand size and morphology. </p>
  <p></p>

  <h2><u>Overview</u></h2>
  <p>Users with atypical hand morphologies or sizes can thus experience discomfort and difficulty reaching the necessary inputs, exacerbating risk for musculoskeletal disorders resulting from the sudden and heavy increase of specialized tool usage. We proposed the design of an ergonomic and adjustable computer video gaming controller that can be customized to fit a variety of hand morphologies.</p>
  <p></p>

  <h2><u>Methods</u></h2>
  <p>Through a contextual inquiry with a user who has difficulty reaching some inputs on his primary controller (a standard computer gaming keyboard) we found that this user sought an easily integratable controller capable of both high intensity gaming and normal computing tasks, that was also compatible with their anatomy. Our final design resembled an ergonomic mouse shaped controller with sliding key banks and a joystick, to be used with the left hand, alongside a gaming mouse with the right hand. Digital inputs would be fully customizable and able to map any key on a keyboard to the desired inputs.</p>
  <p></p>
  
  <h2><u>Skills</u></h2>
  <p>Contextual Inquiry, Interviews, Literature Review, Mechatronic Design, User-Centered Design</p>
  <p></p>

  <h2><u>Reflection</u></h2>
  <p>During a 15-week fully-online course on Augmenting Human Dexterity, we utilized video conferencing to collaborate remotely and propose a design for a new computer interaction tool. This project focused heavily on the design process with a need-knower, or the intended end user. I developed skills working with need-knowers to conduct effective interviews and using the Master/Apprentice contextual inquiry technique that enabled users to express their thoughts without leading questions and bias from a reseacher's perspective. Identifying these primary needs allowed us to develop an inclusive and accessible design as well as propose a research study with metrics like input accuracy and performance in real-world environments to evaluate device effectiveness.</p>
