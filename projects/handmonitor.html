  <p>Rett Syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting normal developmental behaviors in 1 in every 10,000 females born. The symptoms are often confused with autism, as the impaired brain function can often result in difficulties with speaking, learning, and movement. While this is only a short list of symptoms, the hallmark symptom of Rett Syndrome is hand stereotypies, or constant and repetitive hand movements.</p>
  <p></p>

  <p>The Children's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts aims to study the effects of different therapeutics on the hand stereotypies of children with Rett Syndrome. We designed and built a prototype of a device that can monitor hand movements so that a comparison can be made between the child's symptoms before and in response to the therapeutics.</p>

  <p>The device was built using Arduino and reads positional data using an accelerometer. The raw data is saved in a text file for easy manipulation by a multitude of computer programs.</p>
