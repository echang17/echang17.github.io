  <h2><u>Background</u></h2>
  <p>Rett Syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting normal developmental behaviors in 1 in every 10,000 females born. The symptoms are often confused with autism, as the impaired brain function can often result in difficulties with speaking, learning, and movement. While this is only a short list of symptoms, the hallmark symptom of Rett Syndrome is hand stereotypies, or constant and repetitive hand movements.</p>
  <p></p>

  <h2><u>Overview</u></h2>
  <p>The Children's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts aims to study the effects of different therapeutics on the hand stereotypies of children with Rett Syndrome. We worked with them to design and build a device prototype that can monitor hand movements, so that therapeutic responses can be measured by comparing children's symptoms pre- and post-treatment.</p>
  <p></p>

  <h2><u>Methods</u></h2>
  <p>We first scoped the design space using a functional means chart to assess 3 proposed concepts: flexion sensors, optical cameras, or an Arduino microcontroller. Our final prototype was built using Arduino and accelerometer for durability, inexpensiveness, and effective tracking ability. The raw positional data collected could be saved in a text file for easy manipulation by a multitude of computer programs.</p>
  <p></p>

  <h2><u>Skills</u></h2>
  <p>Arduino, Product Design, Client Communication</p>
  <p></p>

  <h2><u>Reflection</u></h2>
  <p>Since this project spanned only 15 weeks as part of an Engineering Design course, our final product met many functional design requirements, but did fall short of some critical usability metrics. As my first project exploring the world of electronics and microcontrollers, I spent a great deal of time learning Arduino programming, and successfully created a device that could achieve the appropriate sampling rates and data outputs. With additional time, I would have liked to work on the fit, size, portability, and comfort of such a device, especially since it is intended to be worn by children.</p>
