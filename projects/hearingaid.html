  <h2><u>Background</u></h2>
  <p>The Cocktail Party Effect is a phenomenon that allows us to distinguish between sounds when we find ourselves in a noisy environment. Unfortunately, when an individual suffers from hearing loss, they lose that ability. Hearing aids can be beneficial in amplifying sound to compensate for damage in the ears, but because they amplify all sound signals, these devices often lack the means to renew the individual's ability to differentiate between signals.</p>
  <p></p>

  <h2><u>Overview</u></h2>
  <p>We designed a proof-of-concept for a new hearing aid that allows for the individual to focus on a specific signal based on their eye gaze. The device only amplifies sound coming from the direction in which the wearer is looking to mimic the cocktail party effect in individuals with hearing loss.</p>
  <p></p>

  <h2><u>Methods</u></h2>
  <p>The device used an electrooculogram (EOG) to detect eye movement from skin electrodes and direct the movement of a microphone encased in a parabolic satellite. We used an oscilloscope to visually confirm the EOG signals as well as a LabView program and DAQ board to convert the signals from analog to digital. The digital signals were then set to an Arduino to drive a stepper motor toward the direction of the eye gaze.</p>

  <h2><u>Skills</u></h2>
  <p>Arduino, Prototyping, LabView, EOG</p>
  <p></p>

  <h2><u>Reflection</u></h2>
  <p>As part of a 15-week Biomedical Engineering Measurements course, we successfully created a device proof-of-concept capable of reading and using human input signals. During the evaluation of our working device, we found that the microphone amplification had good precision, as degrees of eye movement corresponded to expected EOG voltage with low standard deviation, thus accurately moving the microphone to the intended location. The prototype's real-world efficacy was extremely limited, however, by the resolution of the stepper motor, the portability and physical size, and the fact that eye gaze is often decoupled from other body movements that can change the direction of sight (ex. neck rotation).</p>
