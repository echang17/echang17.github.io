  <h2><u>Background</u></h2>
  <p>With Type 1 (T1) diabetes, the pancreas cannot produce insulin, which the body uses to break down glucose to use as energy. This chronic condition can result in acute signs and symptoms, such as diabetic ketoacidosis and long term effects like vision loss, amputation, and death. </p>
  <p></p>

  <h2><u>Overview</u></h2>
  <p>Treatment for T1 diabetes requires regular visits to an endocrinologist and patients utilize continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and insulin delivery devices like pumps. However, there is little information on the experience with diabetes for individuals in marginalized communities (ex. BIPOC, immigrants, low socioeconomic class, elderly, disabled). We sought to learn how people from these groups experience diabetes care and create a digital prototype to address their needs.</p>
  <p></p>

  <h2><u>Methods</u></h2>
  <p>We interviewed 6 individuals, covering BIPOC, elderly, and immigrant groups, and found their interactions with healthcare professionals for diabetes management were generally unhelpful and unpleasant, unless the health professional had diabetes themselves. To create a more patient-forward experience, we brainstormed 3 lo-fi prototypes and created 3 hi-fi prototypes in Figma, then selected one and conducted usability testing with the same interviewed users. The selected Medical Liason protoype featured a virtual assistance, food logging, and trend visualization, compatible with a CGM.</p>

  <h2><u>Skills</u></h2>
  <p>Interviews, User Centered Design, Figma, Usability Testing</p>
  <p></p>

  <h2><u>Reflection</u></h2>
  <p>This project was completed over 15 weeks as part of a User Interface Design and Development course. The selected Medical Liason prototype, which I designed in Figma, was found to be approachable and users stated they would comfortably use it in a real-world setting. Despite a voice note feature, some users preferred the ability to log their personal information manually instead, and focused more on icons for guidance and feature recognition, rather than text explanations. A collective onboarding process with more guided ways to interact with the medical liason was also preferred by the user group. Future iterations of the prototype could include a quick start guide or help function in addition to an added onboarding process, options to customize features, screen reader compatibility, and the ability to log other biometric-related informatino like insulin doses, time & range, and physical activity. </p>
