  <h2><u>Background</u></h2>
  <p>1.3 million people around the world are directly affected by breast cancer, and many more are affected indirectly. Approximately 10-16% of breast cancer cases metastasize to the brain, which makes them even harder to treat due to the need for therapeutics to cross the blood-brain barrier. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one of the most aggressive forms of breast cancer with a 30-40% chance of recurrence. TNBC lacks all three of the common hormone receptors, so many typical chemotherapies are ineffective. Lower survival rate for this subtype in comparison to other breast cancers is almost certainly due to its hyperactive signaling pathways.</p>
  <p></p>

  <h2><u>Overview</u></h2>
  <p>Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors have been used to reduce the cancer cell growth, but TNBC often has mutations in PTEN, a tumor-suppressor gene. This mutation significantly reduces the impact of EGFR inhibitors alone to suppress TNBC tumors and induces hyperactivity in the PI3K pathway, allowing cancer cells to continue proliferating and avoid apoptosis. By targeting the PI3K pathway using oligonucleotides <!--and curcumin-->, we hoped to suppress the pathway such that an EGFR inhibitor could be used in conjunction to renew the ability to achieve cell cycle arrest and apoptosis to destroy the tumor.</p>
  <p></p>

  <h2><u>Methods</u></h2>
  <p>I developed methods to fabricate an experimental nanoparticle-based treatment for the treatment of TNBC cells. Using calcium phosphate nanoparticles, I encased small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting PI3K to silence expression of the overactive pathway. I characterized nanoparticle loading efficiency, release kinetics, and refined the manufacturing protocol. Following the treatment with siRNA-containing nanoparticles, the cells were treated with gefitnib, an EGFR inhibitor, and the combinatory effects of the two treatments were observed using a cell viability assay.</p>

  <h2><u>Reflection</u></h2>
  <p>This project was conducted over the course of a year as my Senior Design Thesis for my Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering. Despite my planned experimental protocol, many unexpected results led me to adapting my methods as the project progressed. During the nanoparticle characterization stage, I often measured large particle sizes and observed visible aggregates, which I had to separate from the main solution via rehydration and a centrifuge. I also devoted time to identifying a method for measuring particle loading efficiency, including testing of various particle lysis buffers and evaluating different metrics like particle diameter, count rate, and surface charge from dynamic light scattering techniques. While I observed cell death percentages around 80% using the combination therapy, repeating the experiment with appropriate controls like gefitnib treatment alone and no treatment conditions would better contextualize these results.</p>
