  <p>Over 30% of football players have sustained at least one concussion prior to the end of high school and over one fifth of concussions sustained are recurrent. Protection and safety are extremely important for youth athletes, whose brains are still developing and especially suseptible to harm. BU recently published a new <a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2645104">study</a> on Chronic Traumatic Encephalophy (CTE), reporting that 99% percent of NFL players whose brains were donated to their research had CTE.</p>
  <p></p>

  <p>We sought to develop a solution to reduce the incidence of concussions in the young athletes who play football. Through research on current solutions and conducting interviews with football players, coaches, and athletic trainers, we created a device to be used during the helmet fitting process, rather than additional equipment to be worn on-field. The Smart-Fit Cap would be used to ensure proper fit in five main regions of the head by indicating to the athletic trainer or coach which areas are sufficiently snug and which are too loose.</p>
  <p></p>
  
  <p>The device was built on Arduino using Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR) technology and LED feedback. The sensors are located in the primary fitting regions and the helmet is worn on top. Regions that are insufficiently snug can be adjusted via inflatable air pump for certain models, added foam padding, or by selecting a smaller helmet size.</p>
